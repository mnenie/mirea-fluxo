## 📦 Installation

```sh
pnpm install
```

> [!NOTE]
> After this command, you will get a working monorepo with shared `packages` and `core` apps

! Put what is needed not only by one `core` app on the `packages` directory

In the `core` directory you can create your app and take some features from `packages` if you need it 👌
